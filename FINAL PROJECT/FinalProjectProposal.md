# **FINAL PROJECT PROPOSAL**

This is where I will propose my Final Project.

Text-based Survival Game.

-- It was a dark and stormy night. The rain was beating hard down the windows of MITT. When, all of a sudden, the power goes out! The ComIT class looks outside to see Zombies making their way into the front doors of the building! To make it to the end, get your certificate and graduate, you have to make it out of the front doors of the school alive!

Initial Goals:
- Text-based, SVG graphics, HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript for the Front-End
- Java for the Back-End (database for inventory, items and hero/enemy stats)
- Static images for things happening. (pick up items, run into enemy)

Secondary Goals: 
- Fully functional maps (first overlooking map, then possible room maps)
- Buttons for movement and map-toggle
- Backpack (visuals for items)
- Clock grabbing local time/date
- Possible co-op of people?

Push Goals:
- Animations for start/cut scenes?
