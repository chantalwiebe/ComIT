# **FINAL PROJECT PROPOSAL**

This is where I will propose my Final Project.

Text-based Survival Game.

-- It was a dark and stormy night. The rain was beating hard down the windows of MITT. When, all of a sudden, the power goes out! The ComIT class looks outside to see Zombies making their way into the front doors of the building! To make it to the end, get your certificate and graduate, you have to make it out of the front doors of the school alive!

## Initial Goals:
- Character Select Screen with Customizable Name / Information / Gender Sprite (6 male, 3 female)
- Text-based, SVG graphics, HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript for the Front-End
- Java for the Back-End (database for inventory, items and hero/enemy stats)
- Static images for things happening. (pick up items, run into enemy)
- Scoreboard for Top !0 tries

## Secondary Goals: 
- Fully functional maps (first overlooking map, then possible room maps)
- Buttons for movement and map-toggle
- Backpack (visuals for items)
- Clock grabbing local time/date
- Possible co-op of people?

## Push Goals:
- Animations for start/cut scenes?


Decription as of now:

...Starts with group of students standing by the window, looking down below at a group of zombies entering the school. Varying sprites are jumping up and down, your character is slightly behind everyone at the top of the class. There is an ambience of two squares from the window all the way down the room. To create a light for yourself of 9 squares (one to each side of you, and 6 infront of you in a 2 2 2 spread). Enemies will enter from offscreen at a slow pace (randomly generated?). There will be items to collect and objects/mazes to avoid.
